PROJECT OF CREDIT CARD PREDICTION USIND ML

The purpose of this project is to conduct quantitative analysis on credit card default risk by using 3 machine learning models with accessible customer data, instead of credit score or credit history, with the goal of assisting and speeding up the human decision making process.

A default analysis system empowered with data mining techniques will allow the credit card issuers to monitor and eliminate the ongoing transactions of potential risky account prior to credit fraud and default.

More studies that are recent have reported that Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods might perform better than the          statistical methods for credit risk assessment. Data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms can assist data managers to improve their problem-solving techniques by discovering meaningful patterns and trends from large amounts of data.

Dataset Source

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit limit, history of payments, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
